# R Best practices: Exercise checklist

This directory contains a script and dataset for the exercises in the course.
After each task, check the box by turning the `[ ]` into `[X]`.

## Tasks

- [ ] Restore the `{renv}` environment.
- [ ] Fix the name of the dataset file.
- [ ] User `{here}` instead of the current path to the dataset.
- [ ] Fix bug.
- [ ] Add comments to the script, using hierarchies.
- [ ] Change the name of the dataframe
- [ ] Fix the spaces and punctuation
- [ ] Use `readr::read_csv()` to read the file and return a tibble.
- [ ] Use the pipe and `dplyr::mutate()` to modify the character columns into factors.
- [ ] Use `dplyr::across()` and `dplyr::case_when()` to obtain a categorical version of the delay columns.
- [ ] Save the filtered dataset as a file with comma-separated values, in a new folder called "output".
